1.2.0 (2003-02-11)
* Can now create disk images. For the moment, these images are not 
  bootable (including hard disk images) - they do however boot a 
  nifty title screen... 
* Files can now be imported into disks. Formats that support this 
  are DOS 3.3 and ProDOS formats. (Pascal and RDOS will come at a 
  later point.) 
* The AppleWorks export now has an option for exporting to 
  Rich-Text Format (RTF). This format can be loaded into many 
  word-processors easily. 
* The graphics export option now supports Super High-Res images. 
  Both unpacked and packed formats. These are essentially raw dumps 
  from the IIGS memory that were saved to disk. 
* Files can be deleted. 
* Any changes to a disk image can be saved. Please be careful! It's 
  easy enough to keep a backup copy of your work these days. 
* Two new DOS derivitaves are available: UniDOS and OzDOS (both are 
  800K formats). 

1.1.1 (2002-11-23)
* Fixed AppleWorks upper/lower case filename resolution.  Human memory 
  proves to be rusty - fortunately, the folks at gno.org have a good 
  reference.  See:
        http://www.gno.org/pub/apple2/doc/apple/filetypes/ftn.1a.xxxx
* Extract AppleWorks word processor (AWP) files.  Extracts as raw text 
  or HTML (semi formatted).  See
                http://www.gno.org/pub/apple2/doc/apple/filetypes/ftn.1a.xxxx
  for a description of the AppleWorks Word Processor file type.
* Expanded wizard to include AppleWorks Word Processor format/rendering 
  options (text or html).
* If a filter is chosen via the drop-down menu on the button, the button 
  thinks it was clicked.  Fixed.
* Exporting a file now warns that a file exists and will as if it should 
  be overwritten.
* Reorganized the user-interface classes.  In particular, segmented 
  DiskWindow into multiple classes (each tab is a separate class now).
* Added user preferences to AppleCommander.  Currently only tracks the disk 
  image directory and the export directory.
* Attempt to identify file filter based on file type, size, and whatever 
  else makes sense.
* Mark all files as GPL.
* Allow multiple file exports.

1.1.0 (2002-11-12)
* AppleCommander still not starting in Windows 98.  InputStream used in 
  image loading was not being closed.  Did not resolve issue.
* Raw extract of file data.
* Extract binary files (differs from raw extract by paying attention 
  to file lengths and any additional overhead which the operating system 
  may store.
* Extract files as text.
* Extract Applesoft files by converting tokens to strings.
* Extract Integer Basic files by converting tokens to strings.
* RDOS files are not being read correctly; maybe this is an issue with 
  the sector skew? Resolved that RDOS images are apprantly 13 sectors. 
  Updated accordingly.
* Fixed bug in DOS Applesoft and Binary file length calculations.  
  Deleted file entries were (a) not being detected correctly which 
  caused (b) the read of file data to crash AppleCommander.  (The initial 
  bytes for A and B file types indicate file length.)
* Updated FileFilter to suggest an appropriate file name.
* Extracting black & white or color (user selected) HGR file format to 
  PNG/JPEG (user selected).  GIF is not a part of ImageIO for writing 
  (apparantly is avilable for reading).
* Fixed issue in determining DOS format disks.  Originally was only 
  checking 3 bytes of the VTOC for valid values.  Extended to check for 8 
  valid values in the VTOC.  Fixed known problem with Crisis Mountain.
* Allow graphic extraction to happen with JDK 1.3 (currently limited to 
  JDK 1.4).  If not possible, disable graphics filter.  Change export 
  options appropriately.
* Extract Apple double hi-res image formats (B&W, color) and convert to 
  PNG/JPEG.  Technical specs are available at - 
  	http://web.pdx.edu/~heiss/technotes/aiie/tn.aiie.03.html
* Double hi-res images are extracted at 560x384 pixels to maintain 
  appropriate aspect ratio.
* Changed method of loading images. This fixed the Windows 98 startup issue.
* When opening a disk image on Linux, the tab is now selected.  This is 
  done implicitly under Windows.  When running under Linux (motif to 
  be precise), there is no default tab and it must be explicitly selected.
* Export wizard. Allows filter to be chosen along with any filter settings 
  (just graphics right now) and export directory.  Settings are remembered 
  between exports.

1.0.1g (2002-10-31)
* AppleCommander would not start under Windows 98.  Looking at where 
  the crash happened, it was the only PNG image in the system.  Converted 
  this PNG image to GIF format and will re-release.  No other code changes.  
  Does not resolve Windows 98 issue.

Website (2002-10-28)
* Make website and announce on comp.sys.apple2.

1.0.1 (2002-10-27)
* Fixed a number of JDK 1.3 issues - code where JDK 1.4 is fine, but 
  the method is not available in JDK 1.3.  These were:
  - NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance() ==> NumberFormat.getNumberInstance().
  - BitMap set(int, boolean) ==> set(int) if true and clear(int) if false.
* Sort bug - if sorting a string that is null or zero length, a 
  NumberFormatException could occur.

1.0 (2002-10-27)
* Change to JDK 1.3 for compile. Needed to change entire workspace.
* Show/hide deleted files. Should be available only on disks which can hold 
  deleted files.
* Support .zip or .gz compression.  Added support for GZIP.  Unable to find 
  an example of a ZIP compressed archive.  Deprecated DiskHelper class - 
  seemed to make sense to merge into the Disk interface itself.
* Modify Disk interface to give a list of file types - in a generic manner - 
  which would be used by the GUI instead of trying to keep GUI in synch with 
  the Disk interface.  Added FileFilter to Disk and added getFileFilters 
  class method.
* Double-click on directory should expand that item.
* Fixed ProDOS filename recognition in the case of a deleted file.
* Right-click menu for directories - expand/collapse; expand all/collapse all.
* Add sorting to file table.

0.92 (2002-10-24)
* Fix icon transparency. Needed to change from PNG to GIF; apparantly SWT 
  does not do PNG transparency.
* Don't use large font in disk usage map; on some displays, the words are 
  cut off and the legend doesn't fit in the window.
* Remove getDirectoryString from FileEntry interface and replace with 
  getFileColumnData.
* In ProDOS view, if address is $0000, it should not be displayed.
* Remember column sizing in file view.
* Improved initial width guess for columns in file view.
* Do not always redraw table - do it intelligently.  Checking both the list 
  of files and the format before deciding upon an action.
* Need icons for delete file and save image.

0.91 (2002-10-21)
* Implement changing views (standard, native, detail).

0.90 (2002-10-17)
* Initial release - basic reading of disks.
