Please see [AppleCommander site](https://applecommander.github.io) for more details. 

[Developer information](DEVELOPER.md) has some details useful if you wish to update AppleCommander.

Some information is still out of date on the AppleCommander site...
* Obviously, we have moved to Github. :-)
* Binaries are in the release tab.
* Mac OS X users may want to visit [lifepillar's homebrew tap](https://github.com/lifepillar/homebrew-appleii) for retro goodness.
* Libary releases to the Maven repository are currently manual and may be a bit delayed.
