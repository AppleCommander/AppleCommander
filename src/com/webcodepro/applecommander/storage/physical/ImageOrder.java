/**
 * Manages the interface between the physical disk image order and the
 * logical operating system specific order.  These management objects
 * are intended to be hidden by Disk itself, although the ImageOrder
 * may be changed (overridden).
 * <p>
 * To implement this class, over-ride the block-oriented methods
 * (readBlock, writeBlock) or the track and sector-oriented 
 * methods (readSector, writeSector).
 * Ensure that isBlockDevice or isTrackAndSectorDevice is set
 * appropriately.
 * <p>
 * Note that a block is generally assumed to be an Apple ProDOS
 * (or Apple Pascal) formatted volume where a block is 512 bytes.
 * The track and sector device is generally a 140K 5.25" disk,
 * although it may be an 800K 3.5" disk with two 400K DOS volumes.
 * In either case, the sector size will be 256 bytes.
 * <p>
 * At this time, the RDOS block of 256 bytes is managed by the 
 * RdosFormatDisk, and the 1024 byte CP/M block is managed by the
 * CpmFormatDisk (the CP/M sector of 128 bytes is largely ignored).
 * <p>
 * Design note: The physical order could alternatively be implemented
 * with a BlockPhysicalOrder structure which includes ProdosOrder
 * and a Track and Sector adapter, as well as a TrackAndSectorPhysicalOrder
 * which includes a NibblePhysicalOrder and DosOrder as well as
 * a Block adapter class.  This way, Disk contains two separate classes
 * (block as well as a track/sector) to manage the disk.
