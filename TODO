THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.2.2 ---
* ProDOS disks now re-use deleted file entries.  Prior to this fix,
  deleted entries were never re-used.  If importing many files, a 
  "Disk Full" error would be generated rather quickly.
* ProDOS file entries do not generate spurious file entries.  There
  was no method of detecting unused entries in pre-1.2.2 code.
* Import file specification should only allow address editing if the filetype
  requires it.
* Fixed parsing of filetype definitions for ProDOS volumes.
* Need to be able to import into a directory in ProDOS.  This will most
  likely involve adding an interface indicating a (writable) directory.
  This interface would be applied to both disks as well as file entries,
  if appropriate.
* ProDOS subdirectories need to allocate another block as they fill up; otherwise
  the directory is limited to the number of entries that fit within the allocated
  space.
* Import now sports a progress indicator and identifies which file is being
  imported.
* Popup dialogs are now centered above the controlling window instead of popping
  up randomly.
* Added a Hex Dump file filter that displays offset into file, hex bytes, and
  the ASCII code.

--- FUTURE 1.2.x ---
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas.
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o HDV disks are not always created to their full capacity.  AppleCommander, however,
  assumes that the size of the file on disk is the size of the disk.  (Really!)
  This is likely an issue because the ProDOS bitmap indicates there is a certain
  amount of space and AppleCommander just assumes that the data exists.
o Compile into native executable (hopefully Linux and Windows).
o Short-cut keys would be nice.
o Need to update preferences with import location, disk creation location.
  
--- FUTURE 1.3.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
o File preview - hex, text, image.  Use FileFilters to convert file to the
  appropriate format?
