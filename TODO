THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.2.1 ---
* Now carries margin setting through, sets font to Courier New (more
  realistic formatting), and fixes boldface not being turned off
  correctly when converting AWP files to RTF format.
* Import could/should choose the filetype based upon the file extension for files
  being imported. Mostly useful for ProDOS; unless a filetype mapping is 
  introduced.
* Extract AppleWorks Data Base files.
* Extract AppleWorks Spread Sheet files.
* Fixed minor issue with ProDOS disks where files at the 128K border would
  be grown (incorrectly) into a Tree file (instead of a Sapling).
* Import of multiple files fails after multiple imports.  This was an issue
  with ProDOS files >128K ("Tree" files).  The delete code didn't handle the
  master index block appropriately when blocks numbered zero were present
  (normally indicating the end of file).

--- FUTURE ---
o Import menu should be in directory pane instead of file pane.
o Need to be able to import into a directory in ProDOS.  This will most
  likely involve adding an interface indicating a (writable) directory.
  This interface would be applied to both disks as well as file entries,
  if appropriate.
o Import file specification should only allow address editing if the filetype
  requires it.
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o The information tab does not get updated.  Now that the disk can be modified,
  this page needs to be updated when shown.
o Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas.
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o HDV disks are not always created to their full capacity.  AppleCommander, however,
  assumes that the size of the disk on disk is the size of the disk.  (Really!)
  This is likely an issue because the ProDOS bitmap indicates there is a certain
  amount of space and AppleCommander just assumes that the data exists.
o Allow group assignments in import. Not really applicable now that datatype is
  chosen by file extension.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Compile into native executable (hopefully Linux and Windows).
o Sector/Block editor.
o Change disk format.
o Short-cut keys would be nice.
