THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.


--- FUTURE ---
o Need to be able to import into a directory in ProDOS.  This will most
  likely involve adding an interface indicating a (writable) directory.
  This interface would be applied to both disks as well as file entries,
  if appropriate.
o Import file specification should only allow address editing if the filetype
  requires it.
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas.
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o HDV disks are not always created to their full capacity.  AppleCommander, however,
  assumes that the size of the disk on disk is the size of the disk.  (Really!)
  This is likely an issue because the ProDOS bitmap indicates there is a certain
  amount of space and AppleCommander just assumes that the data exists.
o Allow group assignments in import. Not really applicable now that datatype is
  chosen by file extension.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Compile into native executable (hopefully Linux and Windows).
o Sector/Block editor.
o Change disk format.
o Short-cut keys would be nice.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
