THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.3.1 ---
* Short-cut keys have been implemented.
  - From AppleCommander window:
    - CTRL+O = Open a disk image
    - CTRL+C = Create a new disk image
    - CTRL+A = About...
  - From disk window
    - Toolbar shortcuts:
      - F2 = Standard file view
      - F3 = Native file view
      - F4 = Detail file view
      - F5 = Show deleted files
      - CTRL+I = Import files wizard
      - CTRL+S = Save
      - CTRL+SHIFT+S = Save As
    - Directory shortcuts (in addition to toolbar shortcuts)
      - "+" = expand one level
      - "-" = close one level
      - CTRL+"+" = expand fully
      - CTRL+"-" = close fully
    - File shortcuts (in addition to toolbar shortcuts)
      - CTRL+E = Export file wizard
      - CTRL+C = Compile BASIC program (BETA)
      - CTRL+V = View file (later version)
      - CTRL+D = Delete file
* Spent time ensuring that buttons, context menus, and shortcuts are enabled or
  disabled as appropriate.
* Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
  - Implemented Save As
  - A save on a new image invokes Save As
* File preview supports:
  - BASIC programs (Applesoft and Integer BASIC); Applesoft BASIC is colored
  - Graphics images (same as supported by the graphics export function)
  - Appleworks (database, spreadsheet, word processor)
  - Text files
  - Hex dump of all the above
  - "Raw" format of all of the above; this includes all data as read from disk
    including length and starting address as well as full sectors/blocks
  - Shortcuts available:
  	- F2 = Native format view (as applicable)
  	- F3 = Hex dump view
  	- F4 = Raw hex dump of disk bytes (includes length or address start along
  	       with all bytes stored on disk - a multiple of 256 or 512 depending
  	       on disk format)
  	- CTRL+A = Select all (only text formats)
  	- CTRL+C = Copy to clipboard (only text formats)
  	- CTRL+P = Print
* Printing is available from the file preview.
* Copy is avilable from file preview except for images.
* Opening an invalid disk image (or a file that is not a disk image) no longer
  crashes AppleCommander.
* Provide a command-line interface - John Matthews "ac" is now supplied as part
  of the AppleCommander distribution.  If AppleCommander gets no command-line
  arguments, the GUI version is launched.  Otherwise, AppleCommander reserves
  the following messages:
  		-swt = force SWT version
  		-swing = force Swing version (N/A - may be removed)
  		-command = force command interpreter (not done - may be superceded by
  		    the "ac" utility)
  Everything else is passed on to John's "ac" command-line version (from the
  application help):
		AppleCommander command line options:
		-l <imagename> list directory of image.
		-e <filename> <imagename> export file from image to stdout.
		-g <filename> <imagename> get raw file from image to stdout.
		-p <destname> <type> <addr> <imagename> put stdin
		   in destname on image, using file type and address.
		-d <filename> <imagename> delete file from image.
		-p140 <imagename> <volname> create a 140K ProDOS image.
		-p800 <imagename> <volname> create a 800K ProDOS image.

--- FUTURE 1.3.x ---
o Compile of BASIC programs
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o Need to update preferences with import location, disk creation location.
o Enhance the BASIC compiler with a few more commands...
o Print file listing or full disk listing (including subdirectories or multiple
  volumes).
o Improve file preview for Integer BASIC files.
o Improve file preview for AppleWorks Word Processor files (make implementation
  generic to a Word Processor).
o Add formatted assembly FileFilter.  Needs to understand multiple assembly programs.
  Need to recognize various formats - T.*, *.S, etc.  (Merlin, Orca, APW, etc).
 
--- FUTURE 1.4.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Added more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
