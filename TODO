THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.3.2 ---
* Print file listing or full disk listing (including subdirectories or multiple
  volumes).
* Added support for Super Hi-Res 3200 color format (PIC of 38400 bytes, file type
  $C1 and auxiliary type $0002).
* Updated preferences to remember the following directory locations:
	- Open
	- Save/Save As (new)
	- Import (new)
	- Export
	- Compile
* Added support for Finder Icons File ($CA or "ICN").

--- FUTURE 1.3.x ---
o Compile of BASIC programs
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o Enhance the BASIC compiler with a few more commands...
o Improve file preview for Integer BASIC files.
o Improve file preview for AppleWorks Word Processor files (make implementation
  generic to a Word Processor).
o Add formatted assembly FileFilter.  Needs to understand multiple assembly programs.
  Need to recognize various formats - T.*, *.S, etc.  (Merlin, Orca, APW, etc).
o SWT image handlers do no appear to work correctly.  BMP works - but color seems
  off.  GIF/PNG/JPEG give errors or a black image.
o Viewing or double-clicking on a directory crashes AppleCommander.
 
--- FUTURE 1.4.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Added more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
