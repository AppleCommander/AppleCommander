THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.3.1 ---
* Short-cut keys have been implemented.
  - From AppleCommander window:
    - CTRL+O = Open a disk image
    - CTRL+C = Create a new disk image
    - CTRL+A = About...
  - From disk window
    - Toolbar shortcuts:
      - F2 = Standard file view
      - F3 = Native file view
      - F4 = Detail file view
      - F5 = Show deleted files
      - CTRL+I = Import files wizard
      - CTRL+S = Save
      - CTRL+SHIFT+S = Save As
    - Directory shortcuts (in addition to toolbar shortcuts)
      - "+" = expand one level
      - "-" = close one level
      - CTRL+"+" = expand fully
      - CTRL+"-" = close fully
    - File shortcuts (in addition to toolbar shortcuts)
      - CTRL+E = Export file wizard
      - CTRL+C = Compile BASIC program (BETA)
      - CTRL+V = View file (later version)
      - CTRL+D = Delete file
* Spent time ensuring that buttons, context menus, and shortcuts are enabled or
  disabled as appropriate.
* Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
  - Implemented Save As
  - A save on a new image invokes Save As
* File preview supports:
  - BASIC programs (Applesoft and Integer BASIC); Applesoft BASIC is colored
  - Graphics images (same as supported by the graphics export function)
  - Appleworks (database, spreadsheet, word processor)
  - Text files
  - Hex dump of all the above
  - "Raw" format of all of the above; this includes all data as read from disk
    including length and starting address as well as full sectors/blocks
* Printing is available from the file preview.

--- FUTURE 1.3.x ---
o Compile of BASIC programs
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o Need to update preferences with import location, disk creation location.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Enhance the BASIC compiler with a few more commands...
o Print file listing or full disk listing (including subdirectories or multiple
  volumes).
o Improve file preview for Integer BASIC files.
o Improve file preview for AppleWorks Word Processor files (make implementation
  generic to a Word Processor).
o Add assembly FileFilter.  Needs to understand multiple assembly programs.
  Need to recognize various formats - T.*, *.S, etc.  (Merlin, Orca, APW, etc).
 
--- FUTURE 1.4.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Added more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
