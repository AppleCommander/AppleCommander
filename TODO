THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.2.0 ---
* Import needs to refresh the file list.
* Release code and tag the version.
* Build and release to SourceForge.

--- 1.2.1 ---
o Import file specification should only allow address editing if the filetype
  requires it.
o Import from right-click menu needs to be enabled.
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o The information tab does not get updated.  Now that the disk can be modified,
  this page needs to be updated when shown.
o RTF export of AWP files could be improved.
o Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas.
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
