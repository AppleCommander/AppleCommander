THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.3.1 ---
o Short-cut keys would be nice.

--- FUTURE 1.3.x ---
o Compile of BASIC programs
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o Need to update preferences with import location, disk creation location.
  
--- FUTURE 1.3.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Added more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
o File preview - hex, text, image.  Use FileFilters to convert file to the
  appropriate format?
