THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.2.3 ---
* Separated image support for GraphicsFileFilter.  This allows easier preparation
  for compiling AppleCommander as a Windows executable (and allows limited image
  support to boot).

--- FUTURE 1.2.x ---
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o Work on identifying why GCJ introduces slow performance to some areas.
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o HDV disks are not always created to their full capacity.  AppleCommander, however,
  assumes that the size of the file on disk is the size of the disk.  (Really!)
  This is likely an issue because the ProDOS bitmap indicates there is a certain
  amount of space and AppleCommander just assumes that the data exists.
o Compile into native executable (hopefully Linux and Windows).
o Short-cut keys would be nice.
o Need to update preferences with import location, disk creation location.
  
--- FUTURE 1.3.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Added more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
o File preview - hex, text, image.  Use FileFilters to convert file to the
  appropriate format?
