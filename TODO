THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

--- 1.3.0 ---
* HDV disks are not always created to their full capacity.  AppleCommander, however,
  assumes that the size of the file on disk is the size of the disk.  (Really!)
  This is an issue because the ProDOS bitmap indicates there is a certain
  amount of space and AppleCommander just assumes that the data exists.
* Incorporated fixes from John Matthews.  See:
	http://www.wright.edu/~john.matthews/ac.html
* Early release of Applesoft BASIC compiler.  This currently is limited to assembly
  of small programs.  If a command is not compiled, you are likely to just get an
  error about expecting a line number.  Expressions are not very complete.  Supported
  commands are:
  		  END, FLASH, FOR, GOTO, GR, HCOLOR, HGR, HGR2, HOME, HPLOT,
  		  HTAB, INVERSE, NEXT, NORMAL, PRINT, RETURN, TEXT, VTAB
  Unsupported commands are:
          ABS, AND, ASC, AT, ATN, CALL, CHR$, CLEAR, COLOR=, CONT, COS,
          DATA, DEF, DEL, DIM, DRAW, EXP, FN, FRE, GET, GOSUB, GR, HIMEM:, 
          HLIN, IF, IN#, INPUT, INT, LEFT$, LEN, LET, LIST, LOAD, LOG, 
          LOMEM:, MID$, NEW, NOT, NOTRACE, ON, ONERR, OR, PDL, PEEK, PLOT, 
          POKE, POP, POS, PR#, READ, RECALL, REM, RESTORE, RESUME, RIGHT$, 
          RND, ROT=, RUN, SAVE, SCALE=, SCRN, SGN, SHLOAD, SIN, SPC, 
          SPEED=, SQR, STEP, STOP, STORE, STR$, TAB, TAN, THEN, TO, TRACE, 
          USR, VAL, VLIN, WAIT, XDRAW, &
  Note that the compiler is not very sophisticated and probably won't be.

--- FUTURE 1.3.x ---
o Compile of BASIC programs
o Save does not allow the disk image location to be chosen for new images. (Maybe
  the wizard should pay more attention?)
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o Short-cut keys would be nice.
o Need to update preferences with import location, disk creation location.
o DELETE does not seem to delete in all circumstances.
  
--- FUTURE 1.3.x (or later) ---
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Provide a command-line interface (scripting - ie, mass load).
o Added more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
o File preview - hex, text, image.  Use FileFilters to convert file to the
  appropriate format?
