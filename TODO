THINGS TO DO
============
This is the internal list of items that need to be done.

-- 1.3.3 --
* Repackage code - packages are getting a bit large.  The goal is to make class
  structure/placement more logical.
  GUI:
  - Moved the SWT wizards into their own packages;
  - Separated utility classes into the util package;
  - Main application windows remain in swt package.
  Storage:
  - Moved OS formats into their respective packages in the "os" package
    (dos33, prodos, cpm, rdos, pascal);
  - Filters are now in the filters package.
  - General storage classes remain under storage (Disk, FormattedDisk, etc).
* Added formatted assembly FileFilter.  Understands Merlin format source files.
  Need to recognize various formats - T.*, *.S, etc.  Need examples for other
  formats (Orca, APW, etc).
* File viewer window now scrolls an appropriate amount: PgUp/PgDn, arrows, 
  mousewheel all work (must select content area first of course).
* Wizard windows no longer show up with the title bar off the screen.

--- FUTURE 1.3.x ---
o Create reusable show dialog messages (they're scattered all over right now) to clean
  up code a bit.
o Refactor FileViewerWindow.
o BUG: Import of binary file does not set starting address.
o MISSING FEATURE: Unable to import a RAW binary image.
? Compile of BASIC programs
? Enhance the BASIC compiler with a few more commands...
o Create subdirectories as appropriate (ProDOS).
o Improve file preview for Integer BASIC files.
o Improve file preview for AppleWorks Word Processor files (make implementation
  generic to a Word Processor).
o SWT image handlers do not appear to work correctly.  BMP works - but color seems
  off.  GIF/PNG/JPEG give errors or a black image.
o It has been reported that Apple Pascal includes extra information at the beginning
  and/or the end of a line - need to resolve this for the preview and export function.
o Resolve OS X issues where window cannot come to the foreground.
 
--- FUTURE 1.4.x (or later) ---
o Add RDOS writing capability.
o Add Apple Pascal writing capability.
o Add CP/M writing capability.
o Add drag-and-drop capability.
o Provide a Swing GUI so people are not "limited" to SWT.  This may be tossed.
o Add more information to About box including GPL, TODO, VERSIONS, etc.
o Change disk format.
o Sector/Block editor.
o Open zip files; be able to browse disk images from the zip file. This should be
  a different type of window (Archive Window?) that allows disk images to be
  opened into a Disk Window.  (Saves would have to be to the file system.)
o Open SHK files?  Similar operation to zip files.
o Open SDK files?  Opens directly into a Disk Window.
o Make formatted images bootable.  May need user to supply a "master" disk from
  which files or data is copied.
o Can AppleCommander read a CF card with ProDOS volumes on it?  This is an IDE device
  connected either via USB or a card reader.  Requires some level of OS integration...
  some form of raw disk access.
