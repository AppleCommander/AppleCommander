This document describes how to setup Eclipse with AppleCommander.  Essentially,
these are the general SWT-related setup tasks that need to be done.  This file
is specifically written for Windows running Eclipse 3.3.  Configuring for other
environments should be similar.


SWT_JAR variable
================
When developing in Eclipse, the SWT library needs to be available.  AppleCommander
has been configured to expect an SWT_JAR environment variable.  To set this up,
go to Window->Preferences->Java->Classpath Variables.  Click on New button and enter 
SWT_JAR for the variable name.  Choose the File button to set the path and locate
the swt.jar.  It will be located, on Windows or Mac respectively, at:
	<ECLIPSE_HOME>/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.3.0.v3346.jar
	<ECLIPSE_HOME>/plugins/plugins/org.eclipse.swt_3.2.2.v3236b.jar
(Or something similar - obviously, the version numbers will change.)
Click OK and close out of each dialog.  Answer YES to the prompt regarding 
recompiling your entire workspace.


Running AppleCommander within Eclipse
=====================================
To launch AppleCommander from within Eclipse, the DLL file associated with SWT
needs to be located by the JVM.  To do this, add the following flag to VM arguments:
	-Djava.library.path="<ECLIPSE_HOME>\plugins\org.eclipse.swt.win32_2.0.2\os\win32\x86"
On Mac, the corresponding libraries are nearby; they can be added to the project properties:
	<ECLIPSE_HOME>/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx_3.2.2.v3236.jar
