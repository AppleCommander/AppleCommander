Configuring Eclipse
===================
This document describes how to setup Eclipse with AppleCommander.
It describes configurations for Windows or Mac with Eclipse 3.3.x.
Configurations for other environments should be similar.

SWT_JAR Classpath Variable
==========================
When developing in Eclipse, the SWT library needs to be available.
AppleCommander has been configured to expect an SWT_JAR environment variable.

On Windows, go to Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Classpath Variables.
Click on New button and enter SWT_JAR for the variable name. Choose the
File button to set the path and locate the swt.jar. A similarly named
file will be located at:
	<ECLIPSE_HOME>/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.3.0.v3346.jar

On Mac, go to Eclipse -> Preferences -> Java -> Classpath Variables to
add the SWT_JAR variable. The corresponding library will look like this:
	<ECLIPSE_HOME>/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx_3.3.3.v3349.jar

Click OK and close out of each dialog.  Answer YES to the prompt
regarding recompiling your entire workspace.

Running AppleCommander within Eclipse
=====================================
On either platform, you can create a new run configuration by selecting Run ->
Open Run Dialog. Create a new Java Application for Project AppleCommander, 
Main class com.webcodepro.applecommander.ui.AppleCommander, and Arguments -swt.

On Windows, the DLL file associated with SWT needs to be located by the JVM. 
To do this, add the following flag to VM arguments:
	-Djava.library.path="<ECLIPSE_HOME>\plugins\org.eclipse.swt.win32_2.0.2\os\win32\x86"

On Mac, no additional configuration is necessary.

The ant file build/build.xml specifies version 1.3 for source and target.
Compatible settings may be specified under Project -> Properties -> Java Compiler
using the Compiler compliance level menu.

Java Build Path
===============
The project's Java build path may be edited by selecting Project ->
Properties -> Java Build Path. Also, look at the Java Build Path help
page. A typical .classpath might look like this On either Windows or Mac:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src"/>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="test"/>
	<classpathentry kind="var" path="SWT_JAR"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.JUNIT_CONTAINER/3"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="bin"/>
</classpath>
