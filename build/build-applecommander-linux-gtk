# This script will build the AppleCommander executable.  Make sure that the
# SWT library (swt.a) is available - see build-swt-linux-gtk if this needs
# to be built.

# The SWT jar files are required as well as the AppleCommander jar file.
# Additionally, the SWT *.so files will be required to run AppleCommander.
# Last but not least, the image files are required by AppleCommander and
# are expected to be in the same directory as Java would expect them to
# be in - but you can remove all the other class or java files.
